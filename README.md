🎉 Countdown to 2025 ⏳
Welcome to my Countdown to 2025 project! This MiniJS project is designed to showcase my JavaScript skills by creating a dynamic countdown timer that ticks down to the start of the year 2025. It displays the exact number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds left until the big moment.

🚀 Project Overview
This project utilizes JavaScript to calculate and update the remaining time until 2025 in real-time. It's a great example of how to manipulate the DOM and work with dates and times in JavaScript.

Key Features:
Real-Time Countdown: The timer updates every second, showing the time left until 2025.
Minimalistic UI: A clean and straightforward user interface that focuses on the countdown.
